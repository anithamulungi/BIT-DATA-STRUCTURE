Project 69: Entrepreneur Pitch Scores.

Descriptions.

Integers:

In this project we use integers to scores  such as the totals, averages, minimum, and maximum scores. This process helps in evaluating the performance of the pitches based on quantitative data.Example if scores are [70,85,60],total=215,average=71.67,min=60,max=85.

Strings:

Strings are text values and in our project we use string to create a report and we use f-strings (formatted strings)to easily display totals and the averages in asimple and readable way.

Booleans:
Boleans store either true or false values ,in our project we check if the average score is above acertain threshold and if it is above the threshold we print above standard and if it is below we print below standard.

Lists:

Lists store multiple values in one variable ,in our project we keep all the pitch scores in the list and we can add,remove sort scores easily.

Arrays:

Arrays are like list but stores only numbers,in our project we use python array module to store numeric pitch scores and then we compute the sum of array and compare it with the list sum.

Dictionaries:

Dictionaries store data in key value pairs which are used to build a list of records for Entrepreneur Pitch Scores, each containing fields such as 'id', 'name', and 'value'. The project includes updating one record, deleting another, and computing the total value across all records.
